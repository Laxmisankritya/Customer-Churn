# Customer Churn prediction

Customer churn is one of the most critical and challenging problems affecting banking industry's competitive environment such as credit card companies.
A bank manager is concerned that more and more clients are canceling their credit card services. They would be grateful if someone could forecast who will be churned so that they can proactively go to the customer to provide better service and influence consumers' decisions in the opposite direction.
This will ultimately help customers to get a better service and report their concerns respectively to the bank personnel. And bank’s service team can dig deeper to eliminate or reduce the flaws in the system eventually building more customer friendly bank. Additionally, metrics for customer churn can help the bank to improve and retain their customers.
The data used for analysis was retrieved from Kaggle.com and is named: Credit Card customers - [Predict Churning customers](https://www.kaggle.com/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers). The dataset is originally taken from leaps [analyttica program’s website](https://leaps.analyttica.com/home).

## Objective:
Gaining the capacity to predict customer churn, allows banks to prevent it by better understanding the needs of their customers. The purpose of this project is to determine which variables are significant in predicting consumer churning by conducting data modelling, statistical and business analysis with the help of R programming language.
